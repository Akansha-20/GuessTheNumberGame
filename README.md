# GuessTheNumberGame

I have made this simple game with c++. In this game the player has to guess a random number between 1-100. There are 3 level of difficulties. Player can choose the level of difficulty. 10 tries make the level easy, 7 tries make the level medium and 5 tries make the level difficult. Player can stop playing by simply entering 0.
